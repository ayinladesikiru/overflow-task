Challenge 1a
The time complexity of the compress function, the challenge 1 a O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the function iterates over the input string once, and the number of operations performed in the
loop is constant. The only additional operation performed is the concatenation of the compressed string at the end
of the function, but this operation also takes constant time.


Challenge 1b
Time complexity of the identify_router() the challenge 1b is O(V + E),
where V is the number of nodes in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph.
